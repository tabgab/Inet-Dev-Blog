## Recent Activity
- b10db98: common: Added DemuxAppFilter to simplify partioning statistical results based on the packet's source application. (by Levente Meszaros)
- c19ee0e: common: Added DemuxRegexFilter that allows partitioning results based on the name of the details object.

For example, it could be used to partition packetLifeTime based on the packet name and thus ultimately the source application. (by Levente Meszaros)
- e5e863f: queueing: Added packetLifeTime @statistics everywhere meanBitLifeTimePerPacket is present.

This helps the user because the other statistic is difficult to understand (name and description) and often they are the same. (by Levente Meszaros)
- ed6f74e: common: Added PacketLifeTimeFilter result filter.

This result filter produces the scalar life time for the whole data part of packet if applicable. (by Levente Meszaros)
- 4bb30ef: bin: Added Python GUI application to see the differences found by chart tests. (by Levente Meszaros)
- 8d37699: BGP: Fix sessionEstablished flag not reset when transitioning to Idle state (#1050)

When BGP FSM transitions from any state to Idle state (due to timeouts,
connection failures, etc.), the sessionEstablished flag was not being
reset to false. This caused BgpRouter::updateSendProcess to continue
attempting to send update messages over closed TCP sockets, resulting
in "TcpSocket::send(): socket not connected or connecting, state is CLOSED"
errors.

This issue was particularly visible in simulations with 10+ BGP routers
where sessions would timeout (connectRetryTime = 120s) before completing
information exchange.

Fixed by ensuring sessionEstablished is set to false in all FSM state
transition functions that call setState<Idle>().

Fixes: BGP session timeout causing socket send errors (by Zoltan Bojthe)

- 4d8521f: SctpHeader: copy(): unnecessary actions, base::copy() already copied these (by Zoltan Bojthe)
- bc810a4: ClockEvent: remove @customize (by Zoltan Bojthe)

- bee0d8f: Ethernet: added 800Gbps Ethernet rate support (#1025) (by Zoltan Bojthe)
- b696115: gen_runallexamples: find files only, skip folders from list (by Zoltan Bojthe)
- 1677f74: gen_runallexamples: use INET_ROOT env variable (by Zoltan Bojthe)
- 819825a: bin: inet_diffingerprints: fixes: shows difference when unique fingerprint lists have different length

also redesigned readFingerprints() for returns list of [eventnumber, fingerprint] pairs (by Zoltan Bojthe)
