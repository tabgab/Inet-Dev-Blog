## Visualizing Chart Test Differences

I've just added a new Python GUI application to make it easier to understand differences found during chart tests.  Previously, when our chart tests found a discrepancy, we'd have to manually pore over log files and compare numerical outputs, which could be tedious and time-consuming.  Now, with this new GUI, we can *visualize* these differences directly. The GUI presents a clear view of the expected chart output alongside the actual output from a simulation, highlighting any deviations. This significantly improves the debugging workflow for our chart tests, making it faster to identify, understand, and address issues in our simulation outputs.  You can find the code in the repository: https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/tree/4bb30efdbb2c213d7122b32ef989dac8d57ae22a.  This is a big step forward for our testing process, allowing for a more efficient and intuitive workflow.
